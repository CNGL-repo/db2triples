Release Notes db2triples v0.9.5
Released on 14/02/2012



1. New features

1.1 Direct Mapping: Cursor mode

- New database extraction method based on JDBC cursor mode 

	* Rows of databases tables are processed one by one. It considerably reduces memory usage.

	* Big database can now be processed (ex: a MySQL database of
          1.5 Go generates 30M triples in 3 hours with native
          triplestore method on a commodity PC. 


1.2 Direct Mapping: Implementation of new W3C Working Draft (of 20 September 2011)

	* Syntax of URIs is now normalized

	* Datatypes treatments are now normalized (in a generic SQL formalism)

	* Any DBMS can now be mapped with its specific driver (tested only on MySQL and PostGreSQL at this time)

	* "XMLSchema base64 encoding" mentioned in literal map
          definition of W3C Working Draft of 20 September 2011 is not
          yet supported.

2. Improvements

2.1 Direct Mapping

- Implementation Version to be used can now be selected (between the
  Working Draft of 23 March 2011 and the Working Draft of 20 September
  2011)

	* New parameter "version" can be specified

- Add support for PostGreSQL (for W3C Working Draft 23 March 2011)

	* Use value "org.postgresql.Driver" in "driver" parameter

2.2 SQL Database Model

- Model completed with new generic interfaces

	* Allow compatibility with cursor mode and several Direct Mapping implementations

2.3 SQL Types Management

- SQL types are distinguished in two categories "generic types" and "specific types"

	* Open Direct Mapping implementations to all DBMS
	
	* Includes compatibility with version of 23 March 2011

	* Includes compatibility with new Working Draft of R2RML (of 20 September 2011) 

2.4 XMLSchema Types Management

- XMLSchema datatype conversions are adapted for generic SQL datatypes.

2.5 Miscellaneous

- Direct Mapping console interface Improvement
	
	* Normalization of parameters name

- "@author" tags have been removed


3. Bug fixes

- Fixes an issue where blank nodes links for empty (non-existent) primary key were broken

	* References to section 2.4.4 in "A Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF" (W3C Working Draft 24 March 2011)

	* References to section 2.5 in "A Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF" (W3C Working Draft 20 September 2011)

	* References to tables rows with no primary key are expressed
          as RDF triples with blank nodes for objects, where this
          blank node is the same node used for the subject in the
          referenced row. [ouch!]
